        Experienced UI developer with rare attention to detail and focus who
        prides himself on creating optimized, standards- compliant web
        applications across frameworks. Self-motivated, communicative, and
        capable of working independently or in large teams effectively and to
        deadlines. Deep foundation of core web principles and constantly hungry
        to learn new technologies. Most happy when producing beautiful React
        components with Styled Components but just as at home with other
        frameworks or dropping down to raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript whenever
        needed.
